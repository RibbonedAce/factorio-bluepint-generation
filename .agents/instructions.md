# Working agreements

These come from the owner's project instructions plus rules they stated during the first session (2026-10-24).

## Roles

- The assistant owns the work inside the repo, but does not decide what leaves it.
- The owner reviews all work, then commits and pushes it. The assistant never pushes and does not commit unless explicitly asked.
- Deliver changes as a patch file or as individual files, together with a suggested commit message.

## Teaching

- The owner is new to Lua. For every piece of code, explain what it does, why it was written that way, and how to read it. Walk through unfamiliar syntax and logic.
- Proactively point out flaws in the owner's approach, even when asked to do it their way. The owner's way and the right way are not always the same; use engineering judgment to bring them together.
- Challenging a proposal is welcome. Silently working against the owner's prompting is not: always say so before deviating.

## Written from scratch

- The repo has another branch, `main`, built by humans. Do not read or reference it unless the owner instructs otherwise. Everything on `llm-main` is written from scratch.

## Iteration

- The owner wants features built very iteratively: for each step, the simplest solution that is still good code quality, meeting only the current criteria. The criteria then grow, in the order of a normal playthrough (products get more complex over time). Do not build ahead for later criteria, but do not make later growth hard either.
- Hardcode the first-tier belts and inserters for now (one place: `scripts/config.lua`).
- When a request leaves out a limit that would make the result wrong (for example a belt that cannot carry the rate), refuse with a clear message or ask; never produce something that silently fails.

## Code structure (owner's request, 2026-10-27)

Keep functions short and simple; the owner reviews against this. Lua has no looser standard than other languages, so the usual rules apply.

- A public function reads as an outline: a few lines that call small private functions, one per step. If a function has numbered or commented sections, each section is a function.
- Rough limits, checked with a size and complexity count before handing work over: about 25 lines per function and cyclomatic complexity (1 + each `if`, `elseif`, `for`, `while`, `and`, `or`) of 8 or less. Going over needs a reason, stated in the handover. A long function with no branching (such as building a GUI) is the mildest case, but still prefer splitting it by what it builds.
- Private helpers are `local function`s defined ABOVE their callers in the same file (Lua needs a name defined before it is used). State shared between helpers goes in one small table that is passed along (see the `index` in `spec/support/blueprint_validator.lua` and `blueprint` in `scripts/layout.lua`), not in file-level variables that change.
- Splitting must not change behaviour. For a refactor, compare old and new code on many inputs (a differential run: same inputs through both versions, diff the printed results) in addition to the tests, and mutation-check the result.
- No linter is installed in the assistant's environment (no `luacheck`). The owner can run `luacheck` with its `max_cyclomatic_complexity` and `max_code_line_length` options on their own machine if they want it enforced automatically.

## Test style (owner's rule, 2026-10-26; enforced on every commit; moved to busted 2026-10-28)

Tests run with [busted](https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/) (`describe` / `it`, luassert assertions), chosen by the owner in place of a hand-rolled framework. Every test is written so it reads as plain English: given some setup, when one thing is called, then something is true. The owner reviews each commit against this.

1. **One `it` = one behaviour, named as a sentence.** Example: `it("a rate just above one furnace's output needs two furnaces", function() ... end)`. The name says what is true, not which function is called. `describe` names the module or the area.
2. **The shape inside the function is setup, then one call, then assertions, separated by blank lines.** Do NOT write `-- given`, `-- when` or `-- then` comments; the layout alone must make it obvious. The call under test is a single statement, and its result goes in a local.
3. **Assertions are luassert's, which read like English:** `assert.are.equal(2, plan.machines)`, `assert.are.same({...}, tiles)` (deep), `assert.is_nil(x)`, `assert.near(expected, actual, tolerance)`, `assert.has_error(fn)`, `assert.matches(text, message, 1, true)`. ARGUMENT ORDER: EXPECTED FIRST, then the actual value (the reverse of what Java/JUnit people expect: `assert.are.equal(expected, actual)`). Custom assertions live in `spec/support/assertions.lua` (today: `has_item_containing(text, list)`, plain-text match), are loaded by `spec/helper.lua`, and have their own specs in `spec/assertions_spec.lua`. Add an assertion there instead of writing a loop or a boolean expression inside a test.
4. **Everything the expectation depends on appears inside the `it`.** A reader must be able to work out the expected value from that one function alone: write the recipe time, belt speed, coordinates and so on in the test (or as a clearly named local there), and show the arithmetic that gives the expected number in a short trailing comment (`-- 3 x 18.75`). It is fine, and expected, that this is not DRY.
4a. **Which game prototypes exist is part of the given.** `fake_prototypes{...}` starts with NO recipes; a test lists the recipe it needs with `a_recipe{energy, ingredients, products}` (all three required) and passes any speed it depends on. Buildings exist by default; a test that needs one missing or odd says so (`missing_entities`, `furnace_speed = false`, `belt_speed = false`). Never change the returned table afterwards.
4b. **Test each use case once, not once per item.** Iron plate, copper plate and stone brick are the same use case; the cases are shapes of recipe (one ingredient to one product, two of one ingredient to one product, one ingredient to two products) and the generator's decisions. The item names in a test are only labels that `scripts/config.lua` happens to support.
5. **Helpers are only for setup the test does not care about** (numbering entities, filling in fake game data the test never looks at, looking an entity up). Helpers live in `spec/support/builders.lua` or as small locals at the top of the spec file. A helper may have defaults, but a value an expectation depends on is passed explicitly by the test (`fake_prototypes{belt_speed = 0.0625}`, `a_catalog{pole_wire_reach = 7}`), never left to a default the reader cannot see.
6. **Prefer small hand-built inputs over output from other modules.** The validator specs build tiny blueprints from `belt(...)`, `furnace(...)` and friends so every coordinate is visible; they do not call the layout. Coordinates in layout code and tests are TILES (the top-left tile an entity covers, see `scripts/grid.lua`), never hand-written centre positions with `+ 0.5`.
7. **No loops over assertions.** A loop that generates separate named tests is fine (`for _, count in ipairs({...}) do it(count .. " furnaces ...", ...) end`); a loop inside one `it` hides which case failed.
8. **Every new or changed test must be shown to fail:** break the code on purpose in a scratch copy (a mutation) and confirm a test fails. The mutation list for the current suite is in `project-status.md`.
9. **Files:** one `spec/<thing>_spec.lua` per module under test; busted finds them by the `_spec` suffix (see `.busted`). Support code is in `spec/support/`. Run `busted` from the repo root.
10. **Busted gotchas.** (a) Busted runs each spec file in its own sandbox: a global assigned in a spec is not seen by the module under test unless it is written `_G.prototypes = ...`. `defines` is set for all specs in `spec/helper.lua`. (b) A failing luassert message prints "Expected objects to be equal. Passed in: ... Expected: ..."; remember "Passed in" is the SECOND argument.

## Git conventions

- Working branch: `llm-main`.
- Commit messages are brief: one imperative subject line (example: `Set mod author to Ribboned Ace`), then the trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Do not add a session link or any other trailer.
- `.agents/` is tracked and must not be gitignored. `.idea/` stays ignored.

## Tooling gotchas (assistant's environment)

- The assistant's clone of the repo is read-only, shallow, and single-branch. It cannot push. Sync it with `git fetch --depth=1 origin llm-main` and compare before producing any patch, so patches apply to the owner's current state.
- To hand over new files in a patch, run `git add -N <path>` first so `git diff` includes them.
- The official docs host `lua-api.factorio.com` refused the assistant's fetch tool on 2026-10-24 (robots rules), including the versioned 2.1.23 pages the owner linked. Do not try to route around this with mirrors or other tools.
- Instead, the owner supplied `runtime-api.json` and `prototype-api.json` (version 2.1.23) as session attachments. They are only available inside that session; in a new session, ask the owner to attach them again before checking the API. Query them with a script and read the gotchas at the top of `research/api-reference-2.1.23.md` (parameter order, blueprint entity variants).
- Interpreters. `texlua` (LuaTeX 1.17, Lua 5.3) is on the machine; `lua`, `luajit`, `pip install lupa`, `apt install lua5.2`, `apt-get install luarocks`, `brew install luarocks` and `npm install fengari` all failed (no apt mirror, no brew, luarocks.org and lua.org blocked with 403 by the network policy; do not retry or route around that). What works: GitHub is allowed. On 2026-10-28, with the owner's approval, a real Lua 5.2.3 was built from `github.com/lua/lua` (tag `v5.2.3`, flags `-DLUA_COMPAT_ALL -DLUA_USE_POSIX -DLUA_USE_DLOPEN -Wl,-E`; `-Wl,-E` is needed or C modules fail with "undefined symbol: lua_gettop") and busted 2.3.0 plus its dependencies were cloned from GitHub (luassert, say, penlight, lua_cliargs, mediator_lua, dkjson, and the C modules luasystem, luafilesystem, lua-term compiled by hand). All of it lives in the assistant's scratch folder, not in the repo, and is lost with the session: rebuild it the same way if needed. Lua 5.2.3 is the closest available match to Factorio's modified 5.2.1; still avoid 5.3-only syntax and format numbers explicitly (see `research/lua-environment.md`). Passing tests prove the logic only, never that Factorio accepts the result. Never claim anything works in game until the owner has run it.
- Check that tests can actually fail: after writing tests, break the code on purpose in a scratch copy (a "mutation") and confirm the tests catch it. Do not trust a suite that has only ever passed.
- Deliver code and notes as SEPARATE patches (code patch: only new or changed code files; notes patch: `.agents/` and `.gitignore`), so the owner can commit them separately. Test each applies to the upstream tip on its own.
- Factorio forum threads failed to load for the fetch tool. Mod portal pages and Friday Facts posts on factorio.com did load.
